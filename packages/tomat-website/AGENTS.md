# AGENTS.md (website)

Scoped guidance for `@tomat/website`. The repo-wide
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) still applies; this file adds what is specific to
the site. Keep it at altitude: conventions and decisions, not command lists
(those live in [README.md](README.md)).

## Overview

A thin Astro static site behind `au.tomat.ing` with two pages: a single-viewport
feature **showcase** home and a markdown **user manual**. It renders the real
`@tomat/shared/ui` components so the previews match the app exactly; the site
itself owns only layout and the showcase choreography. Release artifacts live on
R2 (`get.au.tomat.ing`), never here.

## Conventions

- **Exact-parity rule (CRITICAL, no exceptions).** Any tomat-client component
  represented on the site must render EXACTLY as the app does on default
  settings: spacing, colors, rounding, hover, fonts, transitions. The only way to
  show one is to render the shared `@tomat/shared/ui` component, never a
  re-implementation.
  - **Single source means BOTH sides render it.** A shared component is only
    legitimate if the CLIENT also wraps it. A `*View` that only the website uses
    is a re-implementation in disguise and WILL drift (the settings demo did
    exactly this: a website-only `SettingsContentView` silently lost the group
    header and the sidebar footer because the client never rendered it). Before
    adding or trusting any shared component for a preview, confirm the client
    wraps the SAME component.
  - **Every layer, not just primitives.** Composition is a component too: the
    field row, the section, the group header, the sidebar, the whole panel must
    each be a single shared component that both sides render. Sharing only the
    leaf primitives (Toggle, Input) while each side hand-assembles them is NOT
    enough - the assembly drifts.
  - **Extend, never fork.** If the site needs something a shared component does
    not do yet, extend the shared component (inject client-only behavior -
    validation, pickers, capture, live catalogs - via props/callbacks/snippets)
    so the client keeps using it. Never fork its markup onto the site.
  - **Breakage direction.** If extracting a layer into shared breaks the client,
    fixing the client to wrap the shared component is the next task. A
    client-vs-website divergence is never an acceptable resting state.
- **Sample data comes from `@tomat/shared/ui/samples`.** Every `*View` has named
  sample prop bundles there (built from the settings schema, never hardcoded);
  the showcase stages, the demos, and the component **gallery** all consume them
  so demo state has one home. The gallery (`src/pages/gallery.astro` +
  `components/gallery/Gallery.svelte`) renders every shared View from its samples
  with no `UiContext` provider (so it falls back to `DEFAULT_UI_CONTEXT`); it is
  the canonical parity/QA surface and the manual's screenshot source. The
  `check-view-coverage` lint walker mechanically enforces that every View has a
  sample, a gallery card, and a client wrapper (a website-only View is illegal).
- **Demo-driven interactive states use `hov:` / `act:`.** The scripted cursor
  sets `data-hover` / `data-active` on its target; the shared `hov:`/`act:`
  UnoCSS variants resolve those to the same styles as `:hover`/`:active`, so a
  demo and a real pointer paint identically with no duplicated CSS. Interactive
  shared components already use these; new ones should too.
- **Showcase animation.** Timelines are GSAP, built `paused` and driven by the
  `Showcase` container (auto-play when not scrubbed/scrolling, snap-advance on
  complete). Motion that mirrors a real app transition must use the shared
  helpers (`slideSwap`, `collapseLabel`, `runExpand`) and the canonical timing
  (`BASE_MS`, `CSS_EASING`) so it matches the app's numbers; cursor moves and
  typing are demo-authored. Target elements by stable selectors (`aria-label`,
  `title`, or `data-demo`), resolved lazily so mid-timeline elements still bind.
- Inherited from the repo: no em dashes, lowercase **tomat**, prefer maintained
  packages.

## Key Decisions

- **No-JS support is dropped.** Build features the best way; priority order is
  (1) exact component parity, (2) mobile, (3) general best practices. JS-only
  interactivity (the showcase) is fine.
- **The home page is one `100dvh` viewport:** the showcase (most of the space)
  above a compact install section, capped to the content width, with no vertical
  page scroll.
- **Two pages only.** The changelog was removed; releases are tracked elsewhere.
- **Last updated is git-derived.** Each manual page's "Last updated" date comes
  from the file's last git commit at build time (`src/lib/git-date.ts`), not from
  frontmatter.

## Pointers

- Shared UI system (the source of truth for every preview):
  [`packages/tomat-shared/src/ui/README.md`](../tomat-shared/src/ui/README.md)
  (pattern, tiers, the `*View` contract, samples, gallery, enforcement), over
  `packages/tomat-shared/src/ui` (components, `context.ts`, `samples/`,
  `animations.ts`, `uno-preset.ts`, `styles/base.css`).
- Settings schema + defaults: `packages/tomat-shared/src/domain/settings`
  (`getDefaultSettings`).
- Run / build / release / Cloudflare setup: [README.md](README.md).
- Repo-wide dev loop + channels: [DEVELOPMENT.md](../../DEVELOPMENT.md).
- Content-lock tooling: `scripts/website/`.
