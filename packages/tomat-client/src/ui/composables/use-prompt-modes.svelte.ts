/**
 * The schedule-confirm prompt's editable draft: the working copy of a tool's
 * proposed scheduled prompt while the composer is paused on the confirm form,
 * plus its validity gate and the accept/decline response.
 *
 * Per the composable convention, this class holds the `$state` draft and exposes
 * `scheduleDraftReady` as a pure getter; the consumer keeps the `$derived` reads
 * of the pending stores (permissionRequest / scheduleConfirm / inPromptMode) and
 * the `$effect` that mirrors the pending frame's draft into `scheduleDraft`. The
 * permission prompt carries no editable state, so it stays entirely in the
 * consumer's $derived; only the schedule draft needs a home here.
