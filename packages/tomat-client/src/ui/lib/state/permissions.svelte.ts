/**
 * Reactive store for in-flight runtime permission requests. A
 * `tool.permission_request` frame means a running tool is paused on a Deno
 * permission prompt; UserInput switches into its permission mode (textarea
 * and send controls replaced by the request description + X / check
 * buttons) until the user decides. A single prompt blocks its own worker's
 * JS thread, but concurrent tool calls run in separate workers and can each
 * raise one, so requests are queued and surfaced one at a time (the head is
 * `pending`) instead of clobbering a single slot.
