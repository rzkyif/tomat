// The engine's public entry and the frozen in-process seam.
//
// The portable service graph (chat, sessions, settings, secrets, memories,
// embeddings/relevance, LLM, tools, external STT/TTS, titles) is already fully
// extracted into ./services/* and runs today: the Deno shell (`@tomat/core`)
// serves it via Deno.serve + its Hono `buildApp`, and delivery flows through the
// shared engine FrameBus (frameBus()). So on desktop the engine's logic is live;
// what stays a designed-but-unwired seam is the *in-process transport* below.
//
// `handleHttp` / `connect` are the frozen in-process seam, and BOTH are already
// live on desktop: `handleHttp` builds a Hono app from the engine's OWN reduced
// route set and serves it (app.fetch) for the routes `isEngineRoute` claims,
// which the Deno shell's `main.ts` dispatches straight to it; `connect` runs
// against the real FrameBus (the same registry the WS hub uses, plus tests). That
// route set is the engine's app-domain slice only - NOT the desktop shell's
// shell-coupled routes (sidecars, models, worker-exec, downloads, update), which
// legitimately stay in @tomat/core. What remains for the mobile pass is hosting
// this same interface INSIDE the webview (no Deno.serve, no network) via a
// transport that calls handleHttp/connect; the interface needs no engine rework.
