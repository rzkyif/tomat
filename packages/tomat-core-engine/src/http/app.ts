// The engine's Hono app: the app-domain slice of /api/v1/* that runs on portable
// services (sessions, settings, memories, llm, storage, voice, remote MCP). The
// shell's transport routes (health, pairing, admin) and its OS-bound routes
// (models, binaries, update, requirements, sidecars, scheduled-prompts,
// greetings, extensions, tools) stay in @tomat/core's own app; the shell
// dispatches this app's path prefixes into engine.handleHttp.
//
// Auth is injected: every route group installs clientContextMiddleware with the
// resolver the embedder supplied, so the engine never imports the shell's
// authService.
