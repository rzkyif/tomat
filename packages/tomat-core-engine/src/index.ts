// @tomat/core-engine: the runtime-agnostic heart of tomat-core. It owns the
// portable session/chat/settings/memory logic and exposes it behind a Host
// abstraction, so the same source runs both inside the Deno service
// (`@tomat/core`, which supplies a DenoHost) and, in a future pass, inside the
// mobile client's webview (a webview host). See ./host.ts for the contract and
// the package README for the boundary.
