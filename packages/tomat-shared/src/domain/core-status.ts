// Aggregate, core-reported lifecycle status. The core derives one of these
// from its sidecar readiness, LLM/speech queue depth, active chat turns, and
// boot progress, and broadcasts it as a `core.status` WS frame (and on the
// health response). These are BACKEND states only: the client merges them with
// its own transport states (connecting / reconnecting / disconnected /
// unauthorized) when it paints the CoreBar, because a transport state can never
// ride the wire (you cannot receive a frame while disconnected).
//
// This is the SINGLE status frame: alongside the aggregate it carries the
// per-subsystem breakdown (`subsystems`) and, when busy, the queue counts
// (`queues`), so the CoreBar can fold every sidecar failure into the one `error`
// state and expand to show which subsystems broke and why. The client's
// per-sidecar facade (`serversState`) is rebuilt from `subsystems`.
