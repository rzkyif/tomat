<!-- Positioning + halo-containment wrapper. The body below clips its own

     margins live on the wrapper so it stays the laid-out element in the

     Deliberately NOT `isolate`: the shadow/halo layers sit at z-0 and the
     body at z-10 in the SURROUNDING stacking context, so every bubble's
     shadow paints below every bubble's body and can never cover a
     neighboring bubble. (WebKit's backdrop-filter mis-sampling under a
     transformed ancestor is handled by `bubble-body-promote`, which keeps
     the body on its own compositing layer.) -->

      <!-- Un-inverted window: a copy of the bubble's normal colours clipped to
           the bar's reached region, so the filled part of the progress reads as
           the original (non-inverted) bubble. `transition-[clip-path]` animates
           the determinate grow and the sweep to 100% on exit; the indeterminate
           state instead slides an animated mask (a clip-path animated via
           @keyframes mis-composites in WebKit when it overlaps the inverted
           overlay below, so the band would collapse to the bubble's centre).

           The clip and the filter are split across separate elements ON
           PURPOSE. This window carries ONLY the clip (no filter); the overlay
           above carries ONLY the filter (no clip). They must not share one
           element: WebKit mis-renders an element that has BOTH a `clip-path`
           and a `filter` when it lives inside a `transform`-promoted ancestor
           (the `bubble-body-promote` compositing layer), clipping the filtered
           content to a stale sub-rect even where the clip-path reveals it.

           Children are rendered a second extra time here (base + overlay +
           window); Svelte's bind:expanded on the shared parent state keeps
           every Expandable copy in lockstep, and pointer-events:none routes all
           clicks to the base (lower, un-clipped) copy. -->
