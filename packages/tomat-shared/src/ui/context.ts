// The state surface the extracted presentational components read. In the client
// a provider backs this with the live `settingsState` / `expansionState` stores
// (see lib/ui-context in the client); on the website a provider supplies static
// or demo values. A component never imports a client store directly: it calls
// `useUiContext()` and reads through this interface, so it renders identically
// in both apps and standalone (the DEFAULT_UI_CONTEXT below).
//
// Members that must stay reactive when the client mutates settings are declared
// as getters: reading `ctx.bubbleBlurRings` inside a component's `$derived`
// then tracks the underlying `$state`, because the provider's getter touches it.
//
// Every UiContext is built by `makeUiContext` (below). There is exactly one
// implementation of the settings-derived members, so the three call sites (the
// client provider, DEFAULT_UI_CONTEXT, and the website showcase) cannot drift
// the way a hand-copied object would.
