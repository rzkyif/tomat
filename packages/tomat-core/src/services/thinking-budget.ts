// Per-use-case thinking budget for single-shot utility LLM calls.
//
// Each single-shot use case (title generation, transcription cleanup/merge,
// document summary, complexity check, tool-filter refinement) has its own
// `*ThinkingBudget` number setting. 0 turns thinking off for that call; N>0
// enables it and caps the `<think>` block at N tokens. This reads and
// normalizes one such setting; callers pass it through `overrides.reasoningBudget`
// and add it to their `maxTokens` so the answer still has room after thinking.
