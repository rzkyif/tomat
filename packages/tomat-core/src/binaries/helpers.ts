// the keychain helper present but libsecret missing on Linux), NOT when the
// binary itself is absent. A missing binary means a broken install, and the
// fallbacks would hide it: file-backed secrets instead of the OS keychain, a
// guessed hardware profile, and tool workers spawned without permission prompts
// (ask-state permissions silently failing). Fail loud at boot instead.
