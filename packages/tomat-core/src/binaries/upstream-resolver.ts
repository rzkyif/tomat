// Runtime resolution of upstream sidecar binaries.
//
// On the LATEST channel, binaries.json carries resolver entries (an upstream
// GitHub repo + per-triple asset-name patterns) instead of pinned URLs, so a
// latest core installs upstream releases without us having to re-publish the
// manifest. A resolver without `pinnedTag` tracks the LATEST release; with
// `pinnedTag` it resolves that exact release (deno is pinned this way on
// every channel, because the permission prompt parsing in
// extensions/prompt-parser.ts depends on the prompt wording of the pinned
// version). The signed manifest commits to the repo + patterns; the concrete
// download is verified against GitHub's own published sha256 digest. We
// REFUSE to install an asset that lacks a sha256 digest. There'd be no
// verifiable anchor for the bytes we're about to execute.
//
// A latest resolver does NOT blindly take `/releases/latest`: upstream CI (e.g.
// llama.cpp) publishes the release tag FIRST and then uploads its per-triple
// asset matrix over the following minutes. During that window the newest
// release exists with its assets absent or half-uploaded (`state !== "uploaded"`),
// so resolving against it would fail with no size and never download. Instead we
// scan the most recent releases newest-first and pick the newest one that
// actually carries this triple's asset(s) fully uploaded + digest-verified.
//
// On the STABLE channel, manifest entries are pinned at release time and this
// module isn't involved.
