//   .tar.gz  (llama.cpp upstream; tomat-core-speech): the executable named
//            `<kind>(.exe)` plus any shared libraries (.so/.dylib), located by
//            basename wherever they sit. tomat-core-speech additionally carries
//            an `espeak-ng-data/` tree, preserved verbatim under bin/lib/<kind>/.
//   .zip     (deno, Windows llama): lenient layout -
//            the executable (`<kind>(.exe)`) and any shared libraries
//            (.so/.dylib/.dll) are located wherever they sit in the archive.
//
// Either way the executable lands at bin/<kind>(.exe) and shared libs at
// bin/lib/<kind>/ (the dir each sidecar is launched with as its library path).
