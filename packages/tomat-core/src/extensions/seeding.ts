// In dev the bytes come from the codebase, and the dev-only samples extension is
// seeded the same way (it is never planted or released in prod). If a built-in's
// artifacts aren't planted, it is left for the user to install via the
// (user-gated) extensions UI; we do not fetch on boot. A per-extension marker file
// records a successful seed so that after a user deletes a seeded extension it does
// NOT come back on the next boot.
