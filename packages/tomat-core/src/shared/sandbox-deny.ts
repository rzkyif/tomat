// The core's secret / private paths that a sandboxed child - a tool worker OR a
// deno-runtime MCP server - must never read or write, even when it runs with a
// broad grant (or `--allow-all`). Deno's `--deny-*` flags take PRECEDENCE over
// any `--allow-*`, so passing these as `--deny-read` / `--deny-write` backstops
// any broad grant. Single-sourced here so the tool-worker sandbox and the MCP
// deno spawn can't drift apart in what they protect.
//
// A blanket deny of `root` isn't usable because sessions live under it (and a
// tool may be granted $sessions), so the sensitive subtrees and files are
// enumerated explicitly, including the transient/legacy siblings.
