# MCP servers (core side)

How core connects to Model Context Protocol servers and projects their tools,
prompts, and resources into the rest of tomat. An MCP server is the second kind
of tool provider; the first is an extension
([`../extensions/README.md`](../extensions/README.md)). Core speaks MCP with the
official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` client; it never implements the protocol by
hand.

## Connections and transports ([`manager.ts`](manager.ts))

The manager holds one live `Client` per enabled server and owns no persistence.
`sync(servers)` reconciles the live set against the configured one: it connects
every enabled server that isn't connected and disconnects any whose server is
now disabled or gone. Each connect is independent, so one server failing to
start never blocks the others; a failed connect is remembered as an `error`
status with its message.

Two transports, chosen by the server's `kind`:

- **stdio**: a local `command` (plus `args`) the SDK spawns as a subprocess and
  talks to over its stdio (`StdioClientTransport`). The server's `runtime`
  decides how `command` is launched: `custom` spawns it verbatim (`npx`, `node`,
  `uvx`, an absolute path), while `deno` runs it through the bundled deno
  sidecar (`requireWorkerDeno()`), so `command` is a deno run target (an `npm:`
  specifier, a URL, a script) and npm-based servers need no Node.js install.
  The deno runtime grants `--allow-all` when `denoAllowAll` is set (the default,
  for the widest compatibility) or the server's manual `denoPermissions` flags
  otherwise, and its npm/deno cache is contained under the channel's `DENO_DIR`.
- **remote**: an HTTP/SSE `url` reached with `StreamableHTTPClientTransport`,
  with one of three `remoteAuth` modes. `none` is an open endpoint; `bearer`
  sends a stored static token (see below) as the `Authorization` header; `oauth`
  runs the OAuth 2.1 (PKCE) authorization-code flow via the SDK's `authProvider`,
  attaching and refreshing the stored access token. An `oauth` server that
  hasn't been signed into has no tokens, so rather than let the SDK kick off a
  dynamic registration on every background connect, the manager surfaces a clear
  "sign-in required" status and makes no network call until the user signs in.

A connect failure is reported with the child's piped stderr appended, so a deno
`PermissionDenied` from a too-narrow manual permission set is visible; a missing
`custom` launcher (`spawn ... ENOENT`) is turned into an actionable hint (install
Node.js or switch to the deno runtime; install the Python tool).

On connect the manager fetches the server's `tools`, `prompts`, and `resources`
and caches them in memory; a server may implement only some of those list
methods, so each list is fetched defensively and defaults to empty. It then
watches the live client: a `tools` / `prompts` / `resources` `list_changed`
notification re-fetches just that list, and an unexpected close moves the server
to `error` and schedules a bounded, backoff-spaced auto-reconnect (only for a
server that is still enabled; reconnecting re-establishes a connection the user
already consented to, never a new endpoint). After any such on-its-own change
the manager fires a snapshot broadcast (wired at boot) so clients repaint. The
manager also exposes `callTool`, `getPrompt`, and `readResource` against a
connected server, each bounded by a request timeout and the turn's abort signal
so a hung server can't stall a turn indefinitely.

`sync()` is serialized so two overlapping CRUD requests can't both spawn the
same server (which would leak a child); the auto-reconnect reconciles through
the same chain. `shutdown()` (wired into the core's signal handler) cancels
pending reconnects and disconnects every server so spawned stdio children are
terminated rather than orphaned on exit.

### Trust and consent

A stdio server runs an arbitrary local command OUTSIDE the tool sandbox, and a
remote server is an arbitrary endpoint, so enabling a server is the consent gate:
the client confirms before flipping a server on (servers are created disabled),
and the whole server is the trust boundary (MCP tools carry no per-permission
grants, only an enable toggle). Per-tool and per-prompt toggles default off so a
freshly enabled server can't flood tool selection or the `/` menu.

## Registry and projections ([`registry.ts`](registry.ts))

The DB-backed registry is the configured list of servers (`mcp_servers` table)
plus the user's per-tool and per-prompt enablement (stored as JSON sets on the
row). It owns CRUD and the projections the API serves. `project()` merges a
row's stored config with the manager's live `status` and capability counts into
the shared `McpServer` shape. A remote server's secrets never live on the
row: only a `has_auth` flag (bearer) and an `oauth_authorized` flag (oauth) do.
The bearer token and the OAuth state (client registration, tokens, PKCE
verifier) are stored in the secrets vault under the keys from
[`secret-key.ts`](secret-key.ts), so they never reach the DB or the wire
projection.

The capability listings each cross the row's stored enablement with the
manager's in-memory capabilities:

- `listAllTools()` maps every enabled tool from every connected server into the
  shared `Tool` shape (tagged `providerKind: "mcp"`), so MCP tools sit next to
  extension tools in the Tools UI and the same relevance/permission machinery.
- `listPrompts()` returns every prompt with the user's enable flag; an enabled
  prompt becomes a `/`-triggered command.
- `listResources()` returns every resource (all `@`-referenceable).

## Token resolution ([`tokens.ts`](tokens.ts))

`mcpResolveTokens(text)` expands `@resource` and `/prompt` references in a
turn's user message into prompt blocks, fetched live from the server (so it runs
once per turn over the last user message, not per history message; `#` is never
an MCP reference). A `@resource` is injected as fenced reference DATA (the same
contract as knowledge: data, not instructions); a `/prompt`'s messages are
injected as the instructions the server defines. Resources match by slugged
name; only enabled prompts match, and a prompt with a required argument is
skipped (a `/token` carries no arguments). Each block is capped.

It returns the set of token stems it resolved alongside the block; the chat
service hands that set to the memory token expander so a slug that names both an
MCP resource and a memory expands once (MCP wins) instead of twice.

## Routes ([`../http/routes/mcp.ts`](../http/routes/mcp.ts))

The HTTP routes are CRUD for servers, per-tool / per-prompt enable/disable, a
`reconnect` action, an `oauth/start` action, and the live `prompts` /
`resources` listings the client's `/` and `@` autocomplete consume. Any change
that affects which servers are enabled calls `resync()`, which has the manager
reconcile connections and then broadcasts an `mcp.snapshot` WS frame so every
client repaints.

`oauth/start` ([`oauth-flow.ts`](oauth-flow.ts)) runs the RFC 8252 native-app
sign-in: it opens a short-lived loopback HTTP listener as the redirect target
(so the browser never has to trust core's self-signed cert), runs the SDK's
`auth()` to discover metadata, dynamically register, and build the PKCE
authorization URL, and returns that URL for the client to open in a browser.
When the browser redirects to the loopback listener with the code, the listener
exchanges it for tokens (stored in the vault via
[`oauth-provider.ts`](oauth-provider.ts)), marks the server authorized, and
resyncs. This is a user-initiated action, so opening a browser and reaching the
authorization server is consented network, not background reach.
