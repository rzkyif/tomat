// Build-environment driver interface for the all-targets release.
//
// Each non-host OS is built natively in its own environment, started on demand
// from the M4 host: Linux in a Podman container (podman.ts), Windows in a UTM VM
// (windows.ts). A driver is a dumb artifact producer: it builds its triples into
// the host's dist/ and returns an ArtifactBundle. Signing + upload stay on the
// host.
//
// SCAFFOLD STATUS: the drivers exist but are not yet wired into the live
// resolution in all-targets.ts, because they need machine-specific config (see
// the CONFIG block at the top of podman.ts / windows.ts). Once those are filled,
// activation is: register the drivers here and have all-targets.ts route each
// non-host triple to its driver via withEnvironment().
