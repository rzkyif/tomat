// Cross-platform ("all targets") engine shared by `deno task build` and
// `deno task release`.
//
// A complete release spans 6 triples across 3 OSes plus Android. The speech
// sidecar (static sherpa-onnx) and the Tauri installers can't be cross-compiled,
// so each OS is built NATIVELY in its own environment, started on demand from
// this M4 host:
//
//   darwin   -> the host itself (same-OS cross-arch: both apple-darwin arches)
//   linux    -> a Podman container        (Phase 2)
//   windows  -> the UTM Windows VM         (Phase 3)
//
// This module resolves which requested triples can be built on this machine
// right now. Triples whose environment is not yet wired are reported as skipped
// (the manifests tolerate a partial platform set, so a partial run publishes
// what it built and a later run fills the gaps).
