// The serializable contract between a build environment and the host.
//
// A full all-targets release builds each platform NATIVELY in its own
// environment (the host, a Podman Linux container, the Windows VM), because the
// speech sidecar (static sherpa-onnx) and the Tauri installers can't be
// cross-compiled. Each environment is a dumb artifact producer: it builds into
// dist/<triple>/… and emits a bundle.json describing what it produced. The host
// collects every environment's dist subtree, reads the bundles, and composes +
// signs + uploads the unified manifests ONCE (composeCoreManifest et al. carry
// no R2 carry-forward, so the host must hold the full union before composing).
//
// Paths in a record are RELATIVE to dist/ so they survive the move from an
// environment's filesystem to the host's dist/ (the layout is identical on both
// sides). The host re-anchors each relPath under its own DIST_DIR.
