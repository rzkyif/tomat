// CI post-publish version bump: the committed counterpart to the local release's
// auto-bump. It runs as the final job of the Release workflow, AFTER ci-publish
// has published the latest channel. It bumps the just-published items' version
// files and commits them to `main` ONLY. It does NOT touch `latest` and does NOT
// write the cursor: `latest` stays at the released commit (the codebase as
// actually shipped, un-bumped), and the shared R2 cursor keeps the as-released
// source hash that ci-publish already recorded.
//
// Latest channel only: a stable release is a fast-forward promotion of
// already-bumped versions, so there is nothing to bump (the workflow only runs
// this job on the latest branch; this script also no-ops on any other channel).
//
// Which items to bump: after ci-publish's write, a just-published item's recorded
// cursor version equals its local version (the version file has not advanced yet).
// Every other item was bumped after its last release, so its local version is
// strictly greater. So "recorded.version === local version" selects exactly the
// items this release published and left un-bumped. Source hashes are version-BLIND
// (each item strips its version before hashing) and client/android extraChanged is
// fill-only, so ci-publish only ever publishes items whose source actually changed
// (or a genuine same-version platform fill) - never a lone version bump. That makes
// this selection equivalent to the local auto-bump's "sourceChanged only" filter:
// bumping the just-published items is correct and cannot churn.
//
// No re-release loop: the bump lands on `main`, and a lone version bump no longer
// re-triggers a release, because the version is stripped out of every source hash.
// The pending bump sits on `main` until a REAL source change lands, then ships
// bundled with it on the next `main -> latest` promotion (the higher version clears
// the version-bump gate, which still rejects a source change WITHOUT a bump). This
// job's push is via GITHUB_TOKEN, which GitHub does not let trigger another
// workflow. A non-fast-forward pushMain (a genuine concurrent push during the job)
// still fails loudly.
//
// Flags:
//   --channel=stable|latest    target channel (the workflow sets it from branch)
//   --dry-run                  bump + commit locally; no push
