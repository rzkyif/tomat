// CI post-publish version bump: the committed counterpart to the local release's
// auto-bump. It runs as the final job of the Release workflow, AFTER ci-publish
// has published the latest channel. It bumps the just-published items' version
// files and commits them to `main` ONLY. It does NOT touch `latest` and does NOT
// write the cursor: `latest` stays at the released commit (the codebase as
// actually shipped, un-bumped), and the shared R2 cursor keeps the pre-bump
// (as-released) source hash that ci-publish already recorded.
//
// Latest channel only: a stable release is a fast-forward promotion of
// already-bumped versions, so there is nothing to bump (the workflow only runs
// this job on the latest branch; this script also no-ops on any other channel).
//
// Which items to bump: after ci-publish's write, a just-published item's recorded
// cursor version equals its local version (the version file has not advanced yet).
// Every other item was bumped after its last release, so its local version is
// strictly greater. So "recorded.version === local version" selects exactly the
// items this release published and left un-bumped.
//
// No re-release loop, no guard: the bump lands on `main`, but a Release only fires
// on a push to `latest`/`stable`, and this job's push is via GITHUB_TOKEN, which
// GitHub does not let trigger another workflow. The next release happens when
// `main` is promoted to `latest`; the bumped version then legitimately publishes
// (a version bump alone is a valid release, while a source change without a bump
// is still rejected by the version-bump gate). Because the cursor keeps the
// pre-bump hash, a commit pushed to `main` mid-release stays unpublished and ships
// on the next promotion instead of being masked - so no `head === built` guard is
// needed. A non-fast-forward pushMain (a genuine concurrent push during the job)
// still fails loudly.
//
// Flags:
//   --channel=stable|latest    target channel (the workflow sets it from branch)
//   --dry-run                  bump + commit locally; no push
